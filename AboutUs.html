        <h3>Mzamomtsha Primary School in Mfuleni, Khayelitsha, Western Cape</h3> 
        <p>Mzamomtsha Primary School is a public primary school located at 49 Valangentambo Street.
        It is one of the public primary schools in urban Driftsands suburb, City Of Cape Town in Western Cape Province, South Africa.</p>
        <p>It was a part of a school building programme that focused on a marginalized area affected by apartheid, rapid urbanization and urban migration. As Greg Truen, Project Partner explains, the growing population can be empowered within such a model, and transform itself into part school, part town hall, part civic centre and part sports centre that provide social and economic opportunity.</p>
        <p>Our vision at Mzamomtsha Primary School is to empower students to acquire, demonstrate, articulate and value knowledge and skills that will support them, as life-long learners, to participate in and contribute to the global world and practice the core values of the school: respect, tolerance & inclusion, and excellence.Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs. We stress the total development of each child: spiritual, moral, intellectual, social, emotional, and physical.The School provides facilities in an impoverished and marginalized area on the Cape Flats. The school has sports fields, a library, specialist classrooms and a computer room.</p>
